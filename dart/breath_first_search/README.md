# Breath-first search algorithm
Breath-first search uses queue

The efficiency of breadth-first search in our graph can be calculated by
breaking down the algorithmâ€™s steps into two types:
- We remove a vertex from the queue to designate it as the current vertex.
- For each current vertex, we visit each of its adjacent vertices.
