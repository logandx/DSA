Queues constraints:
- Data can only be inserted at the end of a queue. (This is identical behavior as the stack.)
- Data can only be read from the front of a queue. (This is the opposite of behavior of the stack.)
- Data can only be removed from the front of a queue. (This, too, is the opposite behavior of the stack.)
